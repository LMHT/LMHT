# Contributing to LMHT

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LMHT! Enclosed are guidelines for helping us improve the source code and making LMHT an excellent learning tool.

A couple of ways to contribute to LMHT is by submitting an issue or a pull request, or both.

##Submitting an Issue

Create a new [issue], if you notice any errors within the site or in the documentation.  We love hearing your feedback on any new features you would like to see, too.  

A few guidelines for submitting an issue:

1. Make sure the new issue you are submitting does not already exist as an issue.
2. Consider how your request aligns with current structure and design of LMHT.
3. Be very detailed in the description of your issue - screenshots are helpful.
4. Let us know if you would like to make a pull request regarding the issue you are creating.

## Become a GitHub Contributor

As a contributor, the expectation is that you can use Git and GitHub comfortably enough to fork branches, make pull requests, and practice good commit hygiene.

(These directions are straight from [Contributing to Open Source])

1.  Fork the repository and clone it locally. Attach your local to the upstream repository by adding it as a remote. Pull the changes from upstream so that you are modifying current data when you submit a pull request. More in-depth instructions [here].
2.  Create a branch for your edits. Depending on what you have loaded in your editor, `git checkout -b MyBranch` should suffice.
3.  It is common practice to name your branch according to what it is fixing or updating. Before submitting these changes, verify that they work.
4.  Because the project uses Ajax, you must run a local web server to see your changes.
5. Once you have verified your changes, submit your pull request.

```
$  cd myrepo
$  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Approval Process

We will try our best to respond within a couple days to the issues and pull requests that are submitted.  We prioritize our sprint plans on a weekly basis.  Every pull request goes through a two thumbs-up verification process, before getting merged and deployed.  Keep up to date on the status of your pull request, until it has been merged.

Always feel free to [email] us with any questions, too.
