      <h4>Introduction to LMHT</h4>
      <p>Welcome to LMHT.  This is an open source code repository to help Spanish speakers translate and understand HTML tags.  Originally started as a project by Team Open Brace in the YWebCA Summer of 2015 class, this project is now being developed further as an open source project by Adorable to expand its possibilities.  With your help, we can turn this into an excellent learning tool for bilingual programmers.</p>

      <p>Begin your search by typing in the name of the tag that you want to learn more about in the search box above.  It will automatically populate with available tags.  Remember this is a work in progress, so we do not have all tags yet.<br/>Once you have selected the tag you want, the window will open and show the following key pieces of information: tag name; English base; Spanish translation; audio recording of the tag's pronunciation and definition; definition in English and Spanish; helpful hints for how to remember the meaning of the tag; sample of the tag being used in code</p>
