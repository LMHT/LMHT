      <p>The paragraph is a block level element (as opposed to an inline element) meaning it occupies the entire space of its container or parent element. Therefore, it can contain inline elements within it. Paragraphs are blocks of related text separated from other paragraphs by blank space and usually each paragraph is started with an indentation to mark the start of a new paragraph. Paragraphs are the building blocks of reports, articles, stories, books or any other type of written documentation.</p>

      <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of written documentation just as bricks are the building blocks of buildings.  Put enough connected blocks together and you build a document - put enough bricks together and you have a building.</p>
