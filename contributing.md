## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to LMHT depending on your level of github experience and what you want to accomplish:
    * [Submit an Issue](#submit-an-issue)
    * [Request a Feature](#request-a-feature)
    * [Edit Documentation](#edit-documentation)
    * [Become a GitHub Contributor](#become-a-github-contributor)


## Submit an Issue

Before submitting an issue, please visit the LMHT repository's [Issues page] to verify it is not already a known issue.  If is is a new issue, click "New Issue" in the upper right corner and title it according to what the issue is.  Issues are tracked by title so make it as accurate as possible.  Then leave a detailed comment about what the issue is, where it occurs, what button or feature were you trying to use, what did not work correctly, how should it have worked.  If possible submit screen shots, or any files that apply to document the issue.  Please do not assign any milestones or labels - we will do that.

Once an issue is submitted, we will review it and request any additional information needed to verify the issue.  If it is a valid issue, we will keep it on the issues list to be addressed in the future.

[Issues page]: https://github.com/LMHT/LMHT.github.io/issues

## Request a Feature

Currently, we are using the Issues page to also make feature requests.  Before making a feature request, please review the website and make sure that this feature is in line with the direction the site is going and is a new request.  It is up to you to submit a strong case for getting this feature approved.  If so, then follow the directions above for an issue, and submit your feature request.  Be as detailed as possible about what you want this feature to do.  We will review your case and decide accordingly.  Not all requests will be approved.


## Edit Documentation

There are two ways you can submit a change to documentation.  The [Issues page] can be used as well as [email].  Either way, make a copy of the documentation, edit it-clearly marking the changes you are requesting-and submit it.  Both email and the Issues page allow you to copy the document into your submission.

## Become a GitHub Contributor

If you wish to become a contributor to LMHT, please send an email to lmht@adorable.io that will include basic contact information, what areas you wish to contribute to (areas of expertise) such as english to spanish translation, coding, level of comfort using github.com, etc so that we can get your access set up.  As a contributor, the expectation is that you can use github fluently enough to fork branches, send pull requests and basically maneuver through github to send changes to update or correct the lmht pages as needed.

(These directions are straight from [Contributing to Open Source])

  1.  Fork the repository and clone it locally.  Attach your local to the original "upstream" respository by additing it as a remote.  Pull the changes from upstream daily so that you are modifying current data when you submit a pull request.  More in-depth instructions [here].

  2.  Create a branch for your edits.  Depending on what you have loaded in your editor, 'git checkout -b name-your-branch-here, should suffice.

  3.  It is common practice to name your branch according to what it is fixing or updating.  Before submitting these changes, verify they work.  You can include screenshots of the before and after if the changes are HTML/CSS based and drop those images into your pull request for further verification.  Please try to maintain the look of the site as we currently have it.

  4.  Once you have submitted a pull request, we will review it.  Post any changes or suggestions for review or opinion and handle accordingly.  Not every pull request will be added to our database.  Follow the request to keep up to date on its status.

## Approval Process

Once you have submitted a pull request, we will review it and the issue it is addressing.  If it correctly addresses an outstanding issue, it will go through a two thumbs up verification process at which point it will be merged with the database to fix the issue.

Sometimes, an issue will stay open, even though the bug has been fixed. And
sometimes, the original bug may go stale because something has changed in the
meantime.  We will prioritize the fixes and post accordingly.
