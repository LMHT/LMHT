# LMHT

A project by Team Open Brace in YWebCA.

## Setup

Because this project uses `$.ajax`, you have to have a local webserver for this to work properly on a local machine. If you have OS X:

1. `cd` to the project folder
1. Type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
1. Go to [http://0.0.0.0:8000/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/)
